/// An expandable column widget that supports scrolling while allowing
/// the use of `Expanded` and `Spacer` widgets within its children.
///
/// This widget combines the functionality of a [Column] with scrolling
/// capabilities, making it ideal for layouts that need to expand to fill
/// available space while remaining scrollable when content overflows.
///
/// Unlike a regular [Column] wrapped in a [SingleChildScrollView],
/// [ExpandableColumn] allows you to use [Expanded] and [Spacer] widgets
/// to control space distribution among children while maintaining
/// scroll functionality.
///
/// ## Example
///
/// ```dart
/// ExpandableColumn(
///   padding: EdgeInsets.all(16.0),
///   children: [
///     Text('Header'),
///     Expanded(
///       child: Container(
///         color: Colors.blue,
///         child: Center(child: Text('This fills available space')),
///       ),
///     ),
///     Spacer(),
///     Text('Footer'),
///   ],
/// )
/// ```
///
/// ## Use Cases
///
/// - Forms with varying content heights
/// - Layouts with sticky headers/footers and scrollable middle content
/// - Dynamic content that needs to expand but remain scrollable
///
/// See also:
///
/// * [Column], which provides similar layout but without scrolling
/// * [ListView], which provides scrolling but doesn't support [Expanded]
/// * [SingleChildScrollView], which provides scrolling for a single widget
class ExpandableColumn extends StatelessWidget {
  /// Creates an expandable column widget.

  /// All other parameters are optional and have sensible defaults.

  /// * [ClampingScrollPhysics] for Android-style edge glow

  ///

  /// participates in automatic scrollbar behavior on desktop platforms.

  ///
  /// If true, scrolls from bottom to top instead of top to bottom.
